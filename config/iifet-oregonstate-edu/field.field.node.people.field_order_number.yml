description: "This number helps order the people on the People page in <b>descending</b> order <b>within</b> their IIFET department. <b>HIGHER NUMBERS TAKE PRECEDENT AND COME FIRST.</b> People with the same number will be sorted by their last name alphabetically.\r\nLeaving this number blank will cause the person to be sorted alphabetically as they have no order number associated with them. This is to help facilitate pushing Presidents, President-Elects, or other people of importance to the top of the list."
