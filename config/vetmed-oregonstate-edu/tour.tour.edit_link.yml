    body: "<p>The title text will appear in the menu and it isn't required to match the page title. It is recommended to keep it to 3-5 words, but there is a hard limit of 255 characters. Lengthy menu titles can be difficult to read and cause undesirable wrapping of the menu on smaller devices.</p>"

    body: "<p>This field will either search the content of your site or accept an external URL. When linking to another piece of content in your website, use relative links rather than full 'https://yoursitename.oregonstate.edu' links. More information about relative links can be found on the <a href=\"https://oregonstateuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/Drupal/SitePages/Links.aspx#internal-links\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal how-to site</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: as you type a link target or URL, Drupal will attempt to find the page and auto-suggest pages to link to. If you select one of these auto-suggest pages, the link field will change it to something like 'Divider Options (96)', or '/node/6'</p>\r\n<p>This is internal Drupal linking behavior and expected.</p>\r\n<p>Always test your links to ensure you are targeting the correct page.</p>"

    body: "<p>If you want to create a drop-down in your menu, nest this link under another link selected from this drop down. When the parent link is hovered/tabbed to, this link will then show below it.</p>\r\n<p>Nested menu items will display in the main navigation as drop downs. Multiple nestings result in flyout menus. It is not recommended to nest more than 2 levels.
