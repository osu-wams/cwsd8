You can assign someone multiple roles to give them exactly the amount of permissions you want them to have. For guidance on which role(s) to assign you can read through the Drupal How-to of <a href=\"https://oregonstateuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/Drupal/SitePages/People.aspx#assigning-roles\" target=\"_blank\">Assigning Roles</a> and for a comprehensive list of permissions for each role see <a href=\"https://drupal.oregonstate.edu/osu-drupal-roles\" target=\"_blank\">OSU Drupal Roles</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: granting architect access doesn't give someone the ability to edit any page in the site. They still need to join each group that they want to edit.
