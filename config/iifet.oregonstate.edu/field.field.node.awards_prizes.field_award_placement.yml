description: '<b>This is used for sorting. Use this for when an award has a placement. This placement will -not- be shown on the site. For example, if someone is a "Winner" and another is an "Honorable Mention" or "Highly Commend" use "1st" and "2nd" respectively to have them sorted correctly. If two people have the same placement of awards, they will be sorted alphabetically by last name.</b>'
